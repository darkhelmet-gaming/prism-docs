Configuration
=============

Prism uses a few configuration files:

1. ``prism.conf`` - most configuration settings
2. ``storage.conf`` - database/storage configuration settings
3. ``locale/messages-[lang].properties`` - localization files

Because ``.conf`` files generate with comments explaining the settings, this page won't cover every option.
