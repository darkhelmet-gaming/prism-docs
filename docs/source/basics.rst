Prism logs event data to a database and allows your staff to search/review the data, as well as reverse or re-apply the changes. Primarily used to identify misbehaving players and reverse griefing.

After installing the prism plugin and configuring it for a database you're ready to begin using it.

For newcomers, here are just a few of the many ways to use prism.

Scenario: Block Break Grief
---------------------------

Someone has broken a build that ``fozzy`` made. You are called to investigate.

1. Start with ``/pr near`` to get a sense of nearby activities.
2. One result sticks out: ``animal broke oak planks x25``.
3. ``fozzy`` says ``animal`` did not have permission to break his build.
4. You rollback (reverse) the damage animal did within 20 blocks of you. ``/pr rb p:animal r:20``
