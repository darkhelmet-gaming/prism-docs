Welcome to Prism
================

**Prism (Refracted)** is an event logging plugin for Bukkit-based servers. Prism supports rollbacks, restores, previews, 
wands, and so much more. Tracking so good, the NSA stole our name.

.. note::

   Prism v4 is under active development. It's possible that some of the features documented here change before final release. For Prism v2.x or v3.x, you can find old `documentation here <https://prism-bukkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

History TL;DR
-------------

Prism was created in 2012 by viveleroi. Around 2019 it was taken over by another team but viveleroi eventually returned and continued the project where they left off.

"Refracted" is just a clever pun to clearly indentify the return of it's original author.

Prism Refracted v3 is the same as Prism-Bukkit v2.
