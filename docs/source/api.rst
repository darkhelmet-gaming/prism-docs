API
===

Here are some examples of what you can do with Prism's API:

- Query the activities data and receive results.
- Create and log custom actions/activities.
- Write custom rollback/restore logic for your plugin.

.. note::

   Prism v4 is in development so the API is too. The API is definitely going to change as v4 evolves and we write some sample plugins.
